# Desktop App Development Plan (PyQt-based)

## 1. Environment Setup and Learning 
- [X] Install PyQt and necessary tools (Qt Designer, etc.)
- [ ] Complete PyQt tutorials and basic examples
- [X] Set up a virtual environment for your project

## 2. Code Evaluation and Refactoring 
- [X] Review all Jupyter notebooks
- [ ] Identify common functions and data processing steps
- [ ] Refactor into reusable Python modules
- [ ] Document code thoroughly
- [ ] Implement error handling

## 3. UI Design 
- [X] Sketch application interface
- [X] Plan visual representation of workflow stages
- [ ] Create initial designs using Qt Designer

## 4. Core Functionality Implementation 
- [ ] Port refactored Python code to work with PyQt
- [ ] Implement data loading functionality
- [ ] Implement data processing steps
- [ ] Implement result generation
- [ ] Ensure all core functions work independently of UI

## 5. UI Building 
- [ ] Create main application window
- [ ] Implement controls for each workflow step
- [ ] Add data visualization components (consider using libraries like PyQtGraph)
- [ ] Ensure UI is responsive and user-friendly

## 6. UI-Core Connection 
- [ ] Connect UI elements to backend functions
- [ ] Implement signals and slots for communication between UI and core
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running processes
- [ ] Implement error handling and user feedback mechanisms

## 7. Testing and Refinement 
- [ ] Develop and run unit tests for core functionality
    - [X] Make Tests for Labeller Class
    - [ ] Make Tests for Calculator Class
- [ ] Perform integration testing of UI and core functions
- [ ] Conduct user testing (if possible)
- [ ] Refine UI and functionality based on testing results

## 8. Packaging and Deployment 
- [ ] Research and choose appropriate packaging tool (e.g., PyInstaller, cx_Freeze)
- [ ] Package application for easy distribution
- [ ] Create installers for target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux if applicable)
- [ ] Test deployment on fresh systems

## 9. Documentation and Final Touches 
- [ ] Write user documentation
- [ ] Create a README file with setup instructions
- [ ] Final code cleanup and commenting

Total Estimated Timeline: 5-7 weeks (working 7 hours/day, not exclusively on this project).
