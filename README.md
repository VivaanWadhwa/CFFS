## Objective
To implement the Climate-Friendly Food Systems (CFFS) definition at the UBC Campus by producing the weighted metric that informs the choice of icon for each menu item served by UBC Food Services. Currently, this framework conducts the evaluation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, nitrogen loss, freshwater withdrawals, Land use, and stress-weighted water withdrawals of recipes per serving and 100 grams.

## Scope

The Climate-Friendly Food Sustainability (CFFS) labelling is carried out on five sites, three of which are for UBC Food Services and the two for AMS. 
- UBC Food Services: Open Kitchen, Gather, Feast
- AMS: The Gallery, Blue Chip
